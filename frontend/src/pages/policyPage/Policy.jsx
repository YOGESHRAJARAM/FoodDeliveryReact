    <p><strong>Refunds</strong></p>
<p>Razorpay will send an email to notify you when they receive and inspect a returned item, and whether your refund is approved or rejected. If approved, the refund will be automatically applied to your credit card or original payment method within a certain number of days. The standard timeframe for refunds is 5 to 7 working days, but the exact time depends on the payment method:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Credit/debit cards:</strong> 5 to 10 days</li>
    <li><strong>Net banking:</strong> 2 days</li>
    <li><strong>Wallets:</strong> Instant</li>
    <li><strong>UPI:</strong> 2 to7 days</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instant refunds</strong></p>
<p>Razorpay may be able to process refunds immediately, but if not, they will initiate a normal refund. Razorpay charges a small fee for instant refunds, which is deducted from your Razorpay balance. If the instant refund is unsuccessful, the fee is returned to your balance after 5 to 7 working days.</p>
